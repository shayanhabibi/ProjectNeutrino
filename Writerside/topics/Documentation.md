# Documentation

At the moment I am documenting via the natively integrated <code>Writerside</code> plugin on JetBrains Rider.

If required, the documentation will be re-organised. For the moment, this serves well.

The CI follows the guidelines by JetBrains for <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/writerside/deploy-docs-to-github-pages.html">publishing Writerside documentation to GitHub</a>.
